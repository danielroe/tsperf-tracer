# Type Complexity Tracer

> A VSCode extension to measure type complexity within a project.

ðŸš§ It is a work in progress - help is wanted! ðŸš§

## How it works

To avoid the overhead of launching a separate tsserver, it currently queries the VSCode language server to get information about every token in an open file, and uses the timings of the responses as a proxy for the complexity of the types, following the pattern of [`@definitelytyped/perf`](https://github.com/microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools/blob/41ba894ba571e55fa91ef0bb0d44d6eb6d201943/packages/perf).

## Help wanted

- Improve UX/API of the plugin - for example, add settings to disable/customise how data is displayed to the user
- Investigate the possibility of running a TypeScript trace and consuming this data (which would be much more reliable but might take longer)
- Investigate persistent worker threads that watch changes in a project and update asynchronously (and do not need to reinitialise TypeScript)
- See if it is possible to get extended diagnostics or other diagnostic data from the compiler or tsserver APIs
